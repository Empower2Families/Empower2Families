# Empower2Families

Empower2Families mobile application built using Expo Go, React Native, SQLite, and OAuth.

## Getting Started

To get started developing run the following commands

- `yarn install`
- `npx expo prebuild`
- `npm run <android|ios>`

This will start an Expo Go development server on either Android or IOS. Changed made to the code should mostly live update, when in doubt run `npx expo prebuild` and re-start the development server.
> **Note:** your device must be connected to the machine the development server is running on either using ADB for Android or whatever IOS needs (I don't have an Apple device to test this yet).
